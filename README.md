# Motosfera
ASP.NET MVC Blog app

## 1. What is this project about?
Motosfera is an ASP.NET MVC web application that I created to simply let myself get familiar with building
modern web apps using C#, Blazor, HTML, Bootstrap/CSS and other techs. This app is a very simple blog app
about cars, automotive and racing that allows user to read the content and write some comments, and for admin,
there is a easy-to-use admin-interface.

## 2 . Tech Stack
* C#
* .NET 8.0
* ASP.NET MVC
* HTML
* Bootstrap and CSS
* Entity Framework
* PostgreSQL

## 3. What does it looks like and how does it work?
From user site there is short and simple index site that has navbar, hero-image and list of all posts.

We can click on post card and see the content, add comments etc.

Admin has an access to the login site, no one else can register.

After getting logged, admin gets additional buttons on index site, like Create and Log Out on the navbar

## 4. What is to improve?  
I'm currently working on hosting the page so every interested could see the app live and use it a bit. I really hope to make it happen soon :)  
There is also a plenty of space to improve here - I could use Clean Architecture to make an app easier to maintain or use DTO to separate user actions from database.
Also, I know it would be nice to use more CSS or JavaScript to make the UI more interactive and nicer for the user eye.
