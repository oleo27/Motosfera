# Motosfera
ASP.NET MVC Blog app

**1. What is this project about?**
Motosfera is an ASP.NET MVC web application that I created to simply let myself get familiar with building
modern web apps using C#, Blazor, HTML, Bootstrap/CSS and other techs. This app is a very simple blog app
about cars, automotive and racing that allows user to read the content and write some comments, and for admin,
there is a easy-to-use admin-interface.

**2 . Tech Stack**
-C#
-HTML
-Bootstrap and CSS
-Entity Framework
-PostgreSQL Database

**3. What does it looks like and how does it work?**
From user site there is short and simple index site that has navbar, hero-image and list of all posts.

Admin has an access to the login site, no one else can register.
